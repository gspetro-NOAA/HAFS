Background
----------

Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), as the Unified Forecast System (UFS) hurricane application, is the FV3 (FiniteÂ­ Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core) based multi-scale model and data assimilation system capable of providing tropical cyclone (TC, including hurricane and typhoon) analyses and forecasts of the inner core structure key to improving storm size and intensity predictions, as well as the large-scale environment that is known to influence the TC's motion. HAFS development targets an operational data assimilation and modeling system, capable of providing reliable, robust and skillful model guidances for TC track, intensity (including rapid intensification), size, structure, rainfall and cyclone genesis, as well as for TC associated storm surge, sea surface waves, and tornadoes. HAFS is a community-based coupled earth modeling system specially calibrated for hurricane prediction with TC dynamics and physics, sophisticated vortex initialization and advanced inner-core data assimilation techniques, and various air-sea interaction processes.

HAFSv2 will replace NCEP's current operational hurricane forecast systems, HAFSv1 in the 2024 hurricane season. The goal of this project is to upgrade the HAFSv1 that was running in operations in 2023. The system will provide improved and comparable tropical cyclone track and intensity forecast guidance in all global oceanic basins, as demonstrated through evaluation of retrospective and real time experiments compared against the two current configurations of operational HFSAv1 and HFSBv1.

    - ``./scripts/exhafs_msg_check.py``: to check the message files are properly created by checking the original NHC/JTWC message files in the DCOM directory.
    - ``./ush/setup_hurricane``: for SDM to set up hurricane message files by extracting info from the original NHC/JTWC message files in the DCOM directory.


Pre-implementation Testing
--------------------------

All jobs should be tested as part of this implementation.

**Does this change require a 30-day evaluation (for major implementations only)?**
    No, but all changes have been tested successfully using available input as per the following list: `IT tests list <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qttu6HhZC3I2yEWLIcsTM7BUGxGyevhtZMUU61kSyYI/edit?usp=sharing>`
